# Statistical-Analysis-of-Investor-Decision-Making

I developed a statistical model to analyze the decision-making processes of two investors with similar portfolios. The project involved applying hypothesis testing and confidence interval analysis to determine whether investors should adjust their portfolios or maintain them.

Using R, I implemented key statistical methods, such as t-tests and confidence interval calculations, to guide the investors' decisions, reflecting real-world risk management strategies.
